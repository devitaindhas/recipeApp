    <string name="spagetti">Ingredients : \n\n
                        1 tbsp olive oil \n
                        1 brown onion, chopped \n
                        1 garlic clove, finely chopped \n
                        1 tsp dried mixed herbs \n
                        400g tin tomatoes \n
                        500ml/18fl oz vegetable or beef stock (from a cube) \n
                        400g/14oz dried spaghetti \n
                        salt and pepper \n \n

                        Steps :\n \n
                        1. Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, add the onion and cook gently without browning for 4–5 minutes,
                        or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic, continue to cook for 2 minutes until aromatic,
                        then add the dried herbs, tomatoes and stock. Bring the sauce to a simmer,
                        reduce the heat and simmer gently while you make the meatballs. \n\n
                        2. For the meatballs, mix together the beef, garlic and herbs along with a decent pinch of salt and pepper.
                        Using wet hands roll into 20 balls.\n\n
                        3. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, fry the meatballs on all sides until nicely coloured, being careful not to burn them. You may need to do this in batches. Transfer to the saucepan containing the sauce./n
                        4. Continue to simmer the sauce for 10 minutes while you cook the spaghetti.\n\n
                        5. Bring a large saucepan water to the boil, add a pinch of salt and cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. Once cooked, drain and tip into the saucepan with the meatball sauce. Mix well and serve hot.\n

    <string name="friedRice"> Ingredients : \n\n
                                    1. A fillet of salmon\n
                                    2. 10 medium sized shrimp\n
                                    3. A stalk of celery\n
                                    4. A couple slices of bell pepper\n
                                    5. Half a carrot\n
                                    6. 1 1/4 of uncooked rice\n
                                    7. 2 cups of water\n
                                    8. Olive oil\n \n
                            Steps:\n\n
                            1. Pour the rice into a separate bowl and add water (this doesnt need to be measured since this is for washing the rice only.
                            Stir the rice around several times and pour out the water. Repeat for 2 more times. After, add the 2 cups of water to the washed rice and pour the mixture into the rice cooker.
                            Usually it takes around 30 minutes for the rice to cook.\n\n
                            2. Take out the salmon and shrimp. If they are frozen, soak them in water for about 5 minutes.
                            Chop into small pieces to be added to the rice later.\n\n
                            3. Take out all the vegetables youve gathered and chop into small pieces. This is to be added to the fried rice later.
                            If you want the vegetables to be soft, you can boil them for a couple of minutes.\n\n
                            4. Make some seasoning with salt or whatever suits your tastes. I used salt, soy sauce, and sugar.
                            Cool down the cooked rice. While waiting for the rice to cool, heat up a saucepan to medium high with some olive oil and add the salmon and shrimp. After the seafood is cooked halfway, add the vegetables and cook for a little longer.
                            Add the rice and seasoning. Cook for about 3 more minutes and take off the heat.\n

    <string name="caramel"> Ingredients : \n\n
        1. 225g softened salted butter plus extra for the tins\n
        2. 125g golden caster sugar\n
        3. 100g light brown soft sugar\n
        4. 1 tsp vanilla extract\n
        5. 4 large eggs\n
        6. 225g self raising flour\n
        7. 2 tbsp milk\n
        8. toffee, chocolate or caramel pieces, to decorate\n\n

        Steps:\n\n
        1. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter two 20cm springform tins and line the bases with baking parchment.\n\n
        2. Beat the butter and both sugars in a bowl with an electric whisk for a few mins until lighter in colour and fluffy. Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, adding a spoonful of flour and beating in between each egg. Add the remaining flour and milk. Divide between the cake tins and bake for 25-30 mins until they’re golden, spring back when pressed, and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle.
        Cool in the tins for a few mins, then tip out and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.\n\n
        3. Meanwhile, for the icing, put the butter and icing sugar in a bowl and whisk for a few mins until light and airy. Whisk in the caramel briefly, adding 1 tbsp of boiling water to loosen, if needed.
        Set aside until the sponges are completely cool before assembling, or the icing will melt.\n\n
        4. Use half the icing to sandwich the cakes together, then spread the remainder over the top, smoothing it out with a knife or the back of a spoon. Leave in a cool place until ready to serve. Drizzle with the 3 tbsp extra sauce (warm briefly in the microwave if it’s a little stiff ), allowing some to drip down the sides if you like, and scatter over the toffee, chocolate or caramel pieces to serve. Edible glitter, birthday candles or sparklers, optional.\n
